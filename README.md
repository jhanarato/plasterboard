# Calculate Plasterboard Quantities

As an [owner-builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-build) I need to estimate the
quantities of building materials to order. My current building project is a "granny flat"
a common building class in Australia formally known as an "ancillary dwelling". Mine has
two bedrooms, two bathrooms and an office. For plasterboard (a.k.a. drywall) things were
a bit tricky. Rather than going by square meters as I have done with insulation and 
fibre cement cladding, we decided exactly what size sheets we'd need and how many. In
addition, some walls and ceilings have a double layer of plasterboard. Bathroom walls
are to be tiled and the walls will be lined with [fibre cement sheeting](https://bgcinnovadesign.com.au/facades-linings/bgc-fibre-cement/duraliner-plus/).

To evaluate all this information I've written the code in this repository. I'm unlikely to use the code here again until my next building project but it should still be applicable.
